# Data Visualization of Wage and Salaries vs CPI

- Developed a tool to visually show the correlation between wages and CPI using Python
- Fetched the data using BLS API, and implemented the logic to process the data
- Used Sqlite to store the data, and SQLAlchemy to interact with the database
- Utilized matplotlib to plot the result into a PNG image file, to visually show the correlation between data

### Instruction:

1. download the source code.
2. pip install -r requirements.txt
3. in project folder, create a file with the name api_key.ini, to store your BLS API key. Refer to the file api_key_example.ini for example.
4. the data is stored in output/data.db. The generated image is output/wages_vs_cpi.png
